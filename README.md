# Data_Visualization_Area_Plot
## Area graphs are showing several series, across several different time periods, if there is significant variation among series and change over time.

It can be effective for:
Showing the rise and fall of various data series over time

Conveying total amounts over time as well as some sub-categorical breakdowns (but only to a point)

Emphasizing a part-to-whole relationship over time when one part is very large, or changes from being very large to very small

Showing change over time in individual panels of a small multiple chart
